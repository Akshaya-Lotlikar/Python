Functions in Python
function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.

Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ). Letâ€™s create a function.
def demo(s):
   print (s)
   return
# Function call
demo("Function Called")
